# Event Management System

## Overview

As a software engineer, I built this Event Management System to deepen my understanding of full-stack web development using modern ASP.NET Core technologies. The goal was to create a production-ready MVC application that demonstrates proficiency in database design, user authentication, real-time data management, and responsive web design.

The Event Management System is a comprehensive ASP.NET Core MVC web application that enables users to create, manage, and participate in events. The platform provides complete event lifecycle management—from creation and discovery to RSVP tracking and attendee feedback—in an intuitive, responsive interface. Built with Entity Framework Core and SQLite, the system handles complex relationships between users, events, RSVPs, and feedback while maintaining data integrity and security.

This project was developed to master core software engineering principles: clean architecture, database normalization, secure authentication, object-oriented design patterns, and modern web application development. It serves as a foundation for understanding how real-world event management platforms function at a technical level.
